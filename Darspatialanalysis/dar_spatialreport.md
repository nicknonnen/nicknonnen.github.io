**Spatial Urban Resilience Analysis in Dar es Salaam**

Created 03/31/2021
Revised 04/__/2021

Lab report should include:
1 - question
2 - data, data citations, data descriptions (ethnography)
3 - methods (verbal description of analysis with SQL code blocks, with sufficient explanation and detail to be reproduced)
4 - Results (interpretation, with link to Leaflet map and any static maps)

Goal: Compare population density (using buildings as a proxy) inside and outside buffer zones surrounding urban green space within Dar es Salaam

QUESTION: is pop density greater inside buffer zones compared to pop density in city wards?

Data:
- obtained from the Resilience Academy
- include more fleshed out data ethnography there

Abstract for map:

The presence of green spaces such as parks, gardens, beaches, trees, and fields is common in many cities across the world, and can contribute to increased quality of life, etc etc.
  - correlation between green space and where people live?
  - could this indicate higher resilience?


ABSTRACT

Placement of solid waste sites near water transmission features (“waterways”) such as rivers, streams, canals, drains, and ditches can lead to flooding during rain events if these waste collections block water transmission and egress. Not only can this result in flooding, but it can also lead to increased contact between humans and pathogens, toxins, and other environmental hazards. In this analysis we identify waste collection sites within 50 meters of water transmission features as potentially dangerous waste sites and calculate the density of dangerous waste sites for each ward in Dar es Salaam to identify spatial distribution of environmental vulnerability.
