add notes on spatial twitter conversation and paper Hectares

Wang, Z., X. Ye, and M. H. Tsou. 2016. Spatial, temporal, and content analysis of Twitter for wildfire hazards. Natural Hazards 83 (1):523â€“540.

Prepare a blog post of two paragraphs answering:

Summarize the analytical techniques applied and how the results of those techniques were communicated in text, numbers, tables, or data visualizations
Consder whether you consider this research paper to be reproducibile and whether you consider this paper to be replicable. Refer to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine definitions of reproducibility and replicability and our prior discussions about GIS as a Science.


Analysis Methods:
- use Twitter search API  to find wildfire-related tweets
- keywords: "fire" and "wildfire"
- then implemented a search based on keywords of locations where wildfires occured
  - only used two place names as keywords (why only two??) and then had to filter these results with another check to make sure these tweets are actually talking about wildfires - why not leave it at the first keyword search?

Results:
- i have a few problems with the figures they use
