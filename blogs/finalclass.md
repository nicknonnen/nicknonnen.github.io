ownership in open science:
- small contributions, pull requests, peer reviews ... this all adds up to a new concept of ownership of open science!
- designing research methodology in publications and *code as text*
- using big data and cyberinfrastructure with PostGIS, R, Python
- personal GitHub profiles

other open source sciences
- experimental psych
- data sciences
- computational ecology sciences (?)
 - ^ many of these fields are less "controlled" than other fields such as experimental physics or chemistry

project-based learning
- de-emphasis on specific techniques
- emphasis on research competencies
  - conceptualizations to plans to data to analysis to results to publications
- emphasis on collaboration, research management
- emphasis on critical reflection and public product

doing right by/with GIS
- problem conceptualization
  - asking the right questions?
  - framing in correct ways?
  - questions appropriate to ask?
- thinking about error and construct validity
  - accuracy vs precision, location vs attribute
  - error in motion: propagation, uncertainty
- finishing with ethics - what does it mean to be studying this event? are we thinking about this issue in respectful ways?
