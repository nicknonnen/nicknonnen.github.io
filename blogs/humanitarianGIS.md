Crawford, K., and M. Finn. 2014. The limits of crisis data: analytical and ethical challenges of using social and mobile data to understand disasters. GeoJournal 80 (4):491–502. [DOI:10.1007/s10708-014-9597-z](https://github.com/GIS4DEV/literature/blob/master/The%20limits%20of%20crisis%20data%20analytical%20and%20ethical%20challenges%20of%20using%20social%20and%20mobile%20data%20to%20understand%20disasters.pdf)

Prepare a blog post based upon this prompt:

Consider the Craford & Finn (2014) article and any of the crowd-sourced / volunteered geographic information (VGI) you have already worked with personally (e.g. Twitter, OpenStreetMap) in relation to Longley et al’s framework of uncertainty filters in the process of geograaphic research.

What types of uncertainty are most prevalant in the use of VGI for research on disasters and humanitarian crises?
Do you think that there is any ethical obligation in relation to uncertainty?
Or, do you think that there are ethical concerns in using VGI that complicate uncertainty?
